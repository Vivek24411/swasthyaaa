# Swasthya - Your Comprehensive Fitness App

Welcome to **Swasthya**, a one-stop solution for all your health and wellness needs. Whether you're aiming to build muscle, lose weight, practice mindfulness, or simply stay hydrated, Swasthya has got you covered. This app integrates workout plans, meditation, yoga, calorie tracking, nutrition planning, BMI calculation, motivational quotes, water tracking, exercise tips, and a to-do list â€“ all in one place. Say goodbye to juggling multiple apps for your fitness journey!

Built with **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and **Shared Preferences**, Swasthya is a testament to my dedication to learning and applying these technologies in just **ONE MONTH**. After my end-semester exams, I utilized my entire vacation to learn Flutter, SQLite, Shared Preferences, and Firebase. Although my proposal for Swasthya wasn't selected for the Winter of Code, I remained determined. Discovering **Makers** gave me another opportunity to bring this project to life.
